Figure above shows data sequence for 8 individual columns of complete
image/matrix, along with segmentation (predicted mean values and
states). 

Figure below shows image/matrix for 200 LIDAR shots. Grey vertical
lines indicate columns which were analyzed using graph-constrained
optimal changepoint detection algorithm, and circles show predicted
states.
